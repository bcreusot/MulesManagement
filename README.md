Mules Management will help you manage your mules.
It will automatically add the specific items from your Main character inventory to the bank.
Then, you switch to a mule. When opening the bank, specific items will automatically switch to your inventory from your bank.

For example on my account, my Main is design to send all crafting items to the bank and I got my mules for the craft :
My khajiit : Provisioning (she will have only provisioning items)
My Nord   : Blacksmith and Enchanting
My Argonian : Woodworking and Clothing
My Orc : Alchemy
